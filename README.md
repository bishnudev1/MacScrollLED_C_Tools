# MacScrollLED

> A lightweight macOS CLI utility to control the **Scroll Lock LED** on external keyboards. Perfect for toggling **RGB lights** or triggering **KVM switches** using macOS.

---

## üí° Why This Exists

Some budget-friendly RGB or KVM combo keyboards (like those from **Zebronics**, **Zebronics Transformer**, etc.) use the **Scroll Lock key** as a signal to toggle lighting or switch inputs.  
While this works out-of-the-box on Windows, **macOS does not offer native support** for toggling the Scroll Lock LED programmatically.

This tool solves that problem by:
- Directly interacting with the **IOKit HID APIs**
- Triggering **ON or OFF** state of the Scroll Lock LED
- Allowing users to use their RGB/KVM functionality **from macOS**

---

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

1. Clone or download the source files.

2. **Compile the tools:**

```bash
clang -framework IOKit -framework CoreFoundation -o kvm_on scrolllock_on.c
clang -framework IOKit -framework CoreFoundation -o kvm_off scrolllock_off.c


sudo ./kvm_on   # Turns ON Scroll Lock LED (activates RGB/KVM)
sudo ./kvm_off  # Turns OFF Scroll Lock LED

‚ö†Ô∏è sudo is required because controlling HID devices needs elevated permission.


üîß Advanced Usage
You can wrap these into:
A macOS menu bar utility
A dockless .app
